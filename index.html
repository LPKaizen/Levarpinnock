                                    I graduated from Sheridan College in 2014 with an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering. My first job out of school was working as a 
                                    Data Entry Clerk. I hated it, but loved working from home on my computer, so I stuck it out until a year later when I would start working at Becton Dictonson as an inventory control
                                    Specialist. During my time there I got to work extensively with an SAP-Based database, as well as an Lotus Notes database to moniter and manage inventory at a storage and manucaturing faucility for a year long contract. After
                                    completing my contract, I worked at Premium Retail Services, Working directly with Google as a main client to market and sell Smart Home infranstructure and other IoT devices. after four years of that, I ended up at Amazon, doing
                                    more or less the same thing, but with anything that had Alexa, or Fire OS installed on it.
