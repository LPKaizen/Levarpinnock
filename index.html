                                Shortly after graduating from Sheridan College in 2014 with an advanced diploma in Computer Systems Engineering, I got my first job working IT Support for a small clothing Company called luvali convertibles.
                                After gaining valuable experience, I shifted to Becton Dictonson as an Inventory Control Specialist. During my time there I worked extensively with a SAP-based database, as well as a Lotus Notes 
                                database to moniter and manage inventory at a storage and manufacturing facility.

                                Following this experience, I worked at Premium Retail Services as a Technical Market Trainer, later getting promoted 
                                to Territory Sales Manager. I collaborated with Google as a main client to market and sell smart home infrastructure and smartphones. During this period I helped sucessfully launch the first Google Pixel, Google Home, and Chromecast
                                in Canada. After four great years, I was offered a new opportunity with Amazon, managing all national marketing and sales involving anything that had Alexa, or Fire OS installed on it. In 2022, I left Amazon and later joined Motorola where 
                                I currently work, actively developing the company's telecommunications business in Canada. During my time here, my team and I have sucessfully grown our market segment share to the third highest in the country, second only to Apple and Samsung.
