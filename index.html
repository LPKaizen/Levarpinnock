                         here! (although I can use those when needed), just pure HTML, CSS, and good old JavaScript. I can also code in Python too! Check out my website samples in the tech demos section above!

                                I graduated from Sheridan College in 2014 with an Advanced Diploma in Computer Systems Engineering. My first job out of school was working as a Data Entry Clerk. I hated it, but loved working from home on my computer, 
                                so I stuck it out until a year later when I would start working at Becton Dictonson as an inventory control Specialist. During my time there I got to work extensively with an SAP-based database, as well as an Lotus Notes 
                                database to moniter and manage inventory at a storage and manufacturing facility for a one year contract. After completing my contract, I worked at Premium Retail Services as a Technical Market Trainer, later getting promoted 
                                to Territory Sales Manager, collaborating directly with Google as a main client to market and sell Smart Home infranstructure and Smartphones. During my time I helped sucessfully launch the first Google Pixel, Google Home, and Chromecast
                                in Canada. After four great years, I was offered a similar position with Amazon doing more or less the same thing, but with anything that had Alexa, or Fire OS installed on it.  Then in 2022, I left Amazon and later joined Motorola where 
                                I currently work, actively growing market segment share in their telecommunications business. During my short time here so far, my team and I have helped grow our market segment share to the third highest in the country, second only to Apple and Samsung.
